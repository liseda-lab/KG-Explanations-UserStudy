Explaining Scientific Hypotheses in Drug Development with Knowledge Graphs

This repository contains the resources, data, and code supporting the paper  
**"Explaining Scientific Hypotheses in Drug Development with Knowledge Graphs"**  
presented at ISWC 2025.

##  Overview

We conduct a user-centered evaluation of path-based explanations over biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) using three state-of-the-art systemsâ€”Minerva, PoLo, and RExâ€”along with an ablated variant, RExLight. The study spans two major drug discovery tasks: drug repurposing and drugâ€“target interaction.

Key contributions:
- Comparative evaluation of four KG-based explanation methods.
- A user study with 11 biomedical researchers across three explanation criteria.
- Predictive performance benchmarks on Hetionet, PrimeKG, and OREGANO.
- Visualizations and thematic analysis of qualitative feedback.

## Directory Structure
